A contact list system that contains different types of contacts for the list.

Final project for Data structures and Object-Oriented Programming. (420-202-RE sec.00001). Using object-oriented programming and all the knowledge points covered in the course.

Features :

The system can add, delete, display, search, save contacts (to file) and load contacts (from file);
The system uses a linked list to create connected nodes (which contain contacts);
The system can create new contact objects (personal contact or business contacts) and display the non-null ones;
The system can search any object using the first and last name, and return a message if there are no matches.
The system can discern if any input is invalid and lets the user re-enter those inputs.
The system will remind the user if the contact list is empty for certain methods.
The system can format names and phone numbers. 

How to use :
Use the console to enter inputs. 
From the menu options, choose an option.
Follow the instructions to add, delete, search, save contacts (to file) and load contacts (from file).

I've learned to use exceptions, file I/O and deal with user inputs.
